# Airbnb Price Prediction

This was a project that I completed for my CS229A (Applied Machine Learning) course at Stanford.

I was interested in building a model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on a variety of factors such as neighborhood, host characteristics, etc. Unsurprisingly, the most important factor in New York City was neighborhood.

In addition, I was interested in approaching price from a different angle. I used a TF-IDF NLP algorithm to look at terms that occurred frequently in one price tier, but not another. The results were quite interesting and summarized in the poster.pdf file.
